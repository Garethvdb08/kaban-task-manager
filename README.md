## Overview

This project is a feature-rich Kanban board designed for efficient task management. It allows users to organize their workflow by creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks. Tasks can be seamlessly moved between "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns using a drag-and-drop interface.

The application boasts a sleek, themeable UI with both light and dark modes, and it persists all task data directly in the browser's local storage for a seamless user experience.
